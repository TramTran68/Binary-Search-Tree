# Binary-Search-Tree
Developed a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++ to manage items efficiently.
- Traversal Methods: Implemented recursive tree traversal methods, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order, for data retrieval and visualization.
- Insertion and Deletion: Incorporated item insertion and deletion functionalities, handling cases such as leaf nodes, nodes with one child, and nodes with two children using a recursive approach.
- Item Search: Implemented a binary search recursive function for efficient lookup of items within the BST.
- Height Calculation: Designed a function to calculate the height of the binary tree.
- Print Tree Visualization: Created a tree visualization function that prints the BST structure in a user-friendly format.
